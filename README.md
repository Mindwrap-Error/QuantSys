# QuantSys (Quantitative Trading System)

QuantSys is a self-developed algorithmic trading system designed to research, implement, and backtest systematic trading strategies across multiple asset classes. The project integrates technical indicators with volatility-adjusted position sizing to generate robust and scalable trading signals.

## Features
- Achieved **12.5% annualized returns** on a simulated corpus of 1M INR  
- Implements **RSI, Supertrend, and Donchian Channels**  
- Volatility-adjusted position sizing for controlled risk and minimal drawdowns  
- Backtesting framework with portfolio performance evaluation  
- Emphasis on robust portfolio management and optimization  

## Strategy Overview
The system combines trend-following and mean-reversion indicators, dynamically adjusting position sizes based on volatility. This approach balances risk and return while adapting to diverse market conditions.  

## Results
- Simulated corpus: 1,000,000 INR  
- Annualized returns: **12.5%**  
- Focus: controlled risk, minimal drawdowns, and scalability  

## Roadmap
- Expand to additional asset classes and strategies  
- Incorporate machine learning for adaptive signal generation  
- Deploy live with broker API integration
